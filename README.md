## Self-Assessment
### Reflecting on My Capstone Journey
Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program, the capstone project has been a remarkable experience. It allowed me to dive deeper into areas I’m passionate about, showcase what I’ve learned, and share my knowledge with others. This self-assessment reflects on my growth, challenges, and achievements, highlighting how the program has prepared me to tackle complex problems, design effective solutions, and adapt to evolving technologies. It also serves as an introduction to my portfolio, offering an overview of my academic and personal growth. This repository acts as a foundational documentation of my journey as an individual and provides a way for others to better understand my skills, experiences, and aspirations.
### Gaining Skills Through Coursework and ePortfolio Development
Completing my coursework and developing the ePortfolio have helped me better understand how to present my strengths professionally and prepare for a career in computer science. Throughout the program, I’ve gained valuable skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, adaptability, learning agility, technical development, and communicating effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences.
Working on group projects with like-minded peers taught me the importance of collaboration and clear communication. For example, in a computer graphics and visualization course, actively engaging with classmates—raising questions, sharing ideas, and providing feedback—positively impacted my performance and enhanced my creativity. Understanding stakeholder needs is also a critical part of delivering a product that meets business requirements. Clear communication within the team and a solid grasp of our goals allowed us to work effectively and efficiently throughout the development process.
### Collaborating, Communicating, and Tackling Challenges
Learning data structures and algorithms sharpened my problem-solving skills and prepared me to tackle complex challenges. In my capstone project, I applied these concepts to enhance a handwriting recognition system, leveraging algorithms to solve computational problems. I also gained a strong focus on security, learning to identify vulnerabilities, manage dependencies, and implement secure systems by following both public and company standards.
### Bringing It All Together in My ePortfolio
The artifacts in my ePortfolio reflect how these skills come together, showcasing my ability to solve real-world problems, design effective solutions, and create secure, user-focused systems. Each artifact highlights a key area of my growth and demonstrates my readiness to contribute meaningfully to the computer science field while bringing value and enjoyment to users.
